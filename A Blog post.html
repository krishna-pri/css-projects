        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
            physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of
            science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from
            other natural phenomena.[1]

            The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or
            "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient
            philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which
            originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to
            develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of
            several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by
            pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and
            has steadily gained currency ever since.</p>
